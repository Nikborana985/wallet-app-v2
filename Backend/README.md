### Overview
The backend of the Expense Management Web Application is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides RESTful API endpoints for managing transactions and accounts, allowing users to track their financial health effectively.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/expense-management-app.git
   cd expense-management-app/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your MongoDB database. You can use MongoDB Atlas or a local MongoDB instance.

### Database Connection
In `src/app.ts`, configure the MongoDB connection string:
```typescript
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
mongoose.connect('your_mongodb_connection_string', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
```

### API Endpoints
- **Transactions**
  - `POST /api/transactions`: Create a new transaction.
  - `GET /api/transactions`: Retrieve all transactions.

- **Accounts**
  - `POST /api/accounts`: Create a new account.
  - `GET /api/accounts`: Retrieve all accounts.

### Running the Application
To start the backend server, run:
```
npm start
```
The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

### Testing
To run tests, use:
```
npm test
```
Ensure you have Jest configured for your testing needs.

### Deployment
For deployment, consider using platforms like Railway or Heroku. Make sure to set the environment variables for your MongoDB connection in the deployment settings.
